# Decisions Log

Append-only log of project decisions on a single Confluence page.

## References

- `agents/page-publisher.md` — subagent for markdown→XHTML→POST/PUT with version-bump

- `lib/atlassian-rest.md`
- `lib/confluence-format.md`
- `lib/credentials.md`
- `lib/consent.md`
- `lib/tokens.md`
- `lib/comms-check.md` — runs first
- `lib/plan-format.md` — for optional source: `plans/active/<slug>/decisions.md`
- `lib/user-prompts.md` — structured-input requirement for any user prompt


## User input rules

This skill follows the marketplace-wide user-prompt standard in `lib/user-prompts.md`. Every user prompt MUST use the host client's structured input UI (single-pick, multi-pick, or text-input form). Never freeform plain-text yes/no questions. The only exception is the consent-trigger gate documented in `lib/consent.md`, which waits for user-initiated phrases like "make the ticket".

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 0. Comms check (always first)

See `lib/comms-check.md`. Pause for `to: user` items.

1. Credentials resolved.
2. `{SPACE_ID}` resolved.
3. Optional plan prefill: append entries from one or more `plans/active/<slug>/decisions.md` files into the workspace-level decisions log.
4. Locate existing log page (space-scoped):
   ```
   GET {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/wiki/api/v2/pages?space-id={SPACE_ID}&title=Decisions%20Log&status=current
   ```
   If exists: capture `id` and current `version.number`. If not: will create new.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Logging decisions as made
- Building decision audit trail

Do not use for:
- Full ADR → `architecture-doc`
- Meeting notes without decisions → `session-log`

## Workflow

### 1. Gather entry

- Date (default today, ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
- Decision (one sentence)
- Rationale
- Participants
- Status: Open | Accepted | Implemented | Superseded
- Related links

### 2. Compose entry (markdown)

```markdown
## {YYYY-MM-DD} — {decision title}

**Decision:** ...
**Rationale:** ...
**Participants:** ...
**Status:** Accepted
**Related:** [Ticket](url)
```

### 3. Get consent

"Append to Decisions Log in {SPACE_KEY}?" — wait for trigger phrase.

### 4. Publish

If page exists:
- GET full page body (`?body-format=storage`) to read current `version.number` and `body.storage.value`
- Append new entry XHTML to existing body
- PUT with `version.number = current + 1`

If not exists:
- POST new page titled "Decisions Log"

Both per `confluence-format.md`. Convert markdown entry → storage XHTML.

### 5. Report

```
✓ Decision logged
{date} — {decision title}
{page_url}
```

## Guard Rails

- [ ] Credentials, space resolved
- [ ] Page lookup space-scoped
- [ ] Date in ISO format
- [ ] Status valid value
- [ ] Storage XHTML well-formed
- [ ] Consent trigger received
- [ ] On update: version incremented; on 409, re-GET and retry once
- [ ] URL returned

## Error Cases

**409 conflict:** Re-GET version, retry PUT once. If still 409, abort and surface to user.
Other errors: see `confluence-format.md`.
