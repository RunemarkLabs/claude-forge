# Architecture Documentation

Create an ADR or overview page for Confluence.

- `lib/confluence-format.md`
- `lib/credentials.md`
- `lib/consent.md`

- `lib/comms-check.md` - runs first
- `lib/plan-format.md` - for optional plan prefill
- `lib/user-prompts.md` - structured-input requirement for any user prompt


## User input rules

This skill follows the marketplace-wide user-prompt standard in `lib/user-prompts.md`. Every user prompt MUST use the host client's structured input UI (single-pick, multi-pick, or text-input form). Never freeform plain-text yes/no questions. The only exception is the consent-trigger gate documented in `lib/consent.md`, which waits for user-initiated phrases like "make the ticket".

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 0. Comms check (always first)

See `lib/comms-check.md`. Pause for `to: user` items.

1. Credentials resolved.
2. `{SPACE_ID}` resolved.
3. Optional plan prefill: list `plans/active/<slug>/plan.md` files; offer user to pick one or more (a single ADR may be derived from one plan; an architecture overview may pull from many).

## When to Use

Use for:
- Significant architectural decisions with trade-offs
- Recording rationale and alternatives for future reference

Do not use for:
- Quick design chats
- Implementation detail (use code comments)
- Tech debt → `known-issues`

## Workflow

### 1. Gather context

- Decision title (e.g. "REST vs. GraphQL for public API")
- Context / problem
- Decision (chosen option + reason)
- Consequences (positive + negative)
- Alternatives considered (each with rejection reason)
- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated

### 2. Draft

Save to `/drafts/project-docs/adr-<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# {Title}

## Context
...

## Decision
...

## Consequences

### Positive
- ...

### Negative
- ...

## Alternatives Considered
1. {A} - rejected because ...
2. {B} - rejected because ...
3. {Chosen} - selected because ...

## Status
Accepted

## References

- `agents/page-publisher.md` - subagent for markdown→XHTML→POST/PUT with version-bump
- [Related ADR](url)

Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

Show in chat for review.

### 3. Get consent

"Publish this ADR to {SPACE_KEY}?" - wait for trigger phrase.

### 4. Publish

Convert markdown → storage XHTML.

```
POST {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/wiki/api/v2/pages
```

### 5. Report

```
✓ ADR published
{Title} - Status: {status}
{page_url}
```

## Guard Rails

- [ ] Credentials, space resolved
- [ ] All sections present (context, decision, consequences, alternatives, status)
- [ ] Alternatives include rejection reasons
- [ ] Markdown → storage XHTML
- [ ] Consent received
- [ ] 200 + page id
- [ ] URL returned

## Error Cases

Same as `feature-doc`. See `confluence-format.md` error table.
