# Known Issues Tracker

Single Confluence page tracking known bugs, tech debt, and workarounds.

## References

- `agents/page-publisher.md` — subagent for markdown→XHTML→POST/PUT with version-bump

- `lib/atlassian-rest.md`
- `lib/confluence-format.md`
- `lib/credentials.md`
- `lib/consent.md`
- `lib/tokens.md`
- `lib/comms-check.md` — runs first
- `lib/user-prompts.md` — structured-input requirement for any user prompt


## User input rules

This skill follows the marketplace-wide user-prompt standard in `lib/user-prompts.md`. Every user prompt MUST use the host client's structured input UI (single-pick, multi-pick, or text-input form). Never freeform plain-text yes/no questions. The only exception is the consent-trigger gate documented in `lib/consent.md`, which waits for user-initiated phrases like "make the ticket".

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 0. Comms check (always first)

See `lib/comms-check.md`. Pause for `to: user` items.

1. Credentials resolved.
2. `{SPACE_ID}` resolved.
3. Locate existing page (space-scoped):
   ```
   GET {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/wiki/api/v2/pages?space-id={SPACE_ID}&title=Known%20Issues&status=current
   ```
   Capture `id` and `version.number` if exists.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Documenting known bugs + workarounds
- Tech debt visibility list
- Linking issues to Jira tickets

Do not use for:
- Active bug tracking → Jira
- Feature requests → `feature-doc`

## Workflow

### 1. Gather entry

- Issue title
- Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- Description
- Impact (who is affected?)
- Workaround (if any)
- Status: Open | In Progress | Blocked | Mitigated
- Linked Jira ticket
- Expected fix (timeline, optional)

### 2. Compose entry (markdown table row + detail section)

```markdown
| {issue title} | {severity} | {status} | [{KEY}](url) | {expected fix} |
```

Plus detail block appended below the table:

```markdown
### {issue title}
- **Severity:** ...
- **Description:** ...
- **Impact:** ...
- **Workaround:** ...
- **Jira:** [KEY](url)
```

### 3. Get consent

"Append to Known Issues in {SPACE_KEY}?" — wait for trigger phrase.

### 4. Publish

If page exists:
- GET full body, append entry, PUT with `version.number+1`
If not:
- POST new page titled "Known Issues" with template structure (table header + first entry)

Per `confluence-format.md`. Convert markdown → storage XHTML.

### 5. Report

```
✓ Issue logged
{issue title} — {severity} — {status}
Known Issues: {page_url}
Jira: {ticket_url}
```

## Guard Rails
