# Session Log

Capture session outcomes (decisions, action items, next steps) as a Confluence page.

- `lib/confluence-format.md`
- `lib/credentials.md`

- `lib/user-prompts.md` - structured-input requirement for any user prompt


## User input rules

This skill follows the marketplace-wide user-prompt standard in `lib/user-prompts.md`. Every user prompt MUST use the host client's structured input UI (single-pick, multi-pick, or text-input form). Never freeform plain-text yes/no questions. The only exception is the consent-trigger gate documented in `lib/consent.md`, which waits for user-initiated phrases like "make the ticket".

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 0. Comms check (always first)

See `lib/comms-check.md`. Pause for `to: user` items.

1. Credentials resolved.
2. `{SPACE_ID}` resolved.
3. Optional `parentId` (e.g. an "Sessions" parent page).
4. Optional: check for existing session with same date+title and offer update vs. new page.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Documenting decisions + action items after a working session
- Searchable meeting archive

Do not use for:
- Full transcript (just attach the recording link)
- Decision-only records → `decisions-log`
- Per-action tracking → Jira tickets

## Workflow

### 1. Gather details

- Title (e.g. "Roadmap planning")
- Date (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
- Attendees
- Decisions (bulleted)
- Action items (owner, action, due)
- Next steps
- Related links

### 2. Compose markdown

Save to `/drafts/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Title as `Session - {Date} - {Topic}` for sortable archive.

### 3. Get consent

"Publish session log to {SPACE_KEY}?" - wait for trigger phrase.

### 4. Publish

POST new page (or PUT existing per pre-flight 4). Convert markdown → storage XHTML.

```
POST {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/wiki/api/v2/pages
```

### 5. Report

```
✓ Session logged
{Topic} - {date}
{decisions} decisions, {actions} actions
{page_url}
```
