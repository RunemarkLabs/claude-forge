# Workspace Structure

This file is generated at workspace root by `/runesmith-workspace:reallocate` from the template in `runesmith-workspace/lib/STRUCTURE.template.md`. It documents the canonical workspace layout for any project bootstrapped with this marketplace.

For the destination map and lifecycle rules, see `runesmith-workspace/lib/folder-conventions.md` (the source of truth - this file is the user-facing summary).

## Key conventions

- **Root stays clean.** Only the entries above. Anything else at root = inbox-item → run `/runesmith-workspace:inbox`.
- **`_INBOX/`** - permanent drop zone, transient contents. Inbox skill classifies and routes; reallocate never places files here.
- **`plans/active/<slug>/`** - every plan is a folder. `plan.md` is the entry point. See `runesmith-workspace/lib/plan-format.md`.
- **Tickets** live under their plan in `plans/active/<slug>/tickets/<KEY>.json` pre-push. After push, they move to `archive/tickets-pushed/<YYYY-MM>/`.
- **Research** lives at `research/<topic>/` when standalone; migrates to `plans/active/<slug>/refs/` once a plan adopts it.
- **Source-docs** at `source-docs/<topic>/` while content is being consumed; raw files archive to `archive/superseded/<YYYY-MM>/` after.
- **`comms/`** - Cowork ↔ Claude Code file-based exchange. `open/` is ephemeral; `archive/` is the audit trail. See `runesmith-workspace/lib/comms-protocol.md`.
- **`{PROJECT}.cc/`** - folder name matches the workspace root folder name with `.cc` suffix. Distinguishes this CC workspace from others.
- **Atlassian config** - toggled by `/runesmith-sprint:enable` and `/runesmith-sprint:disable`. Marker file `.atlassian-enabled` and CC marker JSON.

## Skills that maintain this structure

- `/runesmith-workspace:reallocate` - migrates and normalizes the workspace; refreshes this file
- `/runesmith-workspace:inbox` - processes `_INBOX/`
- `/runesmith-core:plan` - writes plans into `plans/active/<slug>/`
- `/runesmith-cc:bootstrap-cc` - creates `{PROJECT}.cc/`
- `/runesmith-sprint:enable` - wires Atlassian into the project
- `/runesmith-sprint:plan-to-tickets` - writes ticket drafts under their plan
- `/runesmith-sprint:check-comms` - triages `{PROJECT}.cc/comms/open/`
