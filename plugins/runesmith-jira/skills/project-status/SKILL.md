# Project Status

Quick status check from Jira - what's in progress, done, blocked, backlog.

Read-only. No consent gate required.

## References

- `lib/atlassian-rest.md` - `/search/jql` POST
- `lib/credentials.md`
- `lib/tokens.md`
- `lib/comms-check.md` - runs first
- See also `atlassian:sprint-status` for atlassian-enabled sprint-aware view

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 0. Comms check (always first)

See `lib/comms-check.md`. Pause for `to: user` items.

1. Credentials resolved.
2. `{PROJECT_KEY}` resolved.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Quick board view in chat
- Sprint planning context
- Blocker scan

Do not use for:
- Creating / updating tickets
- Long-form status report → `status-report` (in operations plugin)

## Workflow

### 1. Query Jira

```
POST {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/rest/api/3/search/jql
{
  "jql": "project = {PROJECT_KEY} ORDER BY updated DESC",
  "fields": ["summary", "status", "assignee", "priority", "labels", "updated"],
  "maxResults": 50
}
```

(Do NOT use deprecated `GET /rest/api/3/search`.)

### 2. Group results

By `status.name`:
- In Progress
- Blocked (status=Blocked OR labels contain "blocker")
- Selected for Development / To Do
- Done (last 7 days only)

### 3. Output

```
{PROJECT_KEY} status

In Progress (n)
- KEY-1 summary - assignee
- KEY-2 summary - assignee

Blockers (n)
- KEY-3 summary

Next up (top 3)
- KEY-4 summary
- KEY-5 summary

Recently done (last 7d)
- KEY-6 summary

Board: {ATLASSIAN_API_URL}/jira/software/projects/{PROJECT_KEY}/boards
```

## Guard Rails

- [ ] Credentials, project key resolved
- [ ] Query uses `/search/jql` POST, not GET `/search`
- [ ] Counts accurate
- [ ] Blockers separated
- [ ] Output scannable

## Error Cases

**401:** Re-read `.credentials`, retry once, then "Run `/core:setup`."
**404:** "Project {PROJECT_KEY} not found."
**410 / endpoint gone:** Re-check `atlassian-rest.md` for current path.
**Empty:** "No tickets in {PROJECT_KEY}. Try /atlassian:ticket."
