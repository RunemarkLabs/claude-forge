# Code Tech Debt (CC-side)

Scan repos in `{PROJECT}.cc/<repo>/` for unused code, dead exports, orphaned files, and stale dependencies. Per-language analyzers, extensible via the language registry in `@lib/code-analyzers.md`. Read-only by default - flags findings, proposes removals; user consent required for any deletion.

This skill is deployed to `{PROJECT}.cc/.claude/skills/code-tech-debt/SKILL.md` by `/runesmith-cc:bootstrap-cc` running in Cowork. Do not edit it directly here unless you intend the change to flow to all future bootstraps.

## References

- `@lib/code-analyzers.md` - per-language analyzer registry (tools, heuristics, fallbacks). Source of truth for adding new language support.
- `.claude-code-workspace` (marker, in CC root) - for `repos[]` list (which repos to consider in scope)
- The repo's own config files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.) drive per-repo language detection

## Scope

This skill scans repos under `{PROJECT}.cc/<repo>/`. It does NOT touch:
- Workspace-level files outside the CC head
- `{PROJECT}.cc/comms/` (CC's exchange area)
- `{PROJECT}.cc/.claude/` (CC's own config and skills)
- `.git/` directories
- Any path under `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `target/`, etc. (build artifacts)

For workspace-level tech debt (orphaned plans, unreferenced drafts, stale research), use `/runesmith-devtools:tech-debt` on the Cowork side.

## When to Use

Use for:
- After a refactor - find leftover dead code
- Before a release - verify no orphaned files or unused deps
- Periodic hygiene per repo
- When file count seems too high vs. what's actually in use

Do not use for:
- Functional code review (use `/engineering:code-review` if available, or PR review tooling)
- Security scanning (use dedicated security tools)
- Workspace-level concerns (Cowork's tech-debt)

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 1. Repo target

If the user invokes without a target repo, list repos from `{PROJECT}.cc/.claude-code-workspace`'s `repos[]` array. Surface a structured single-pick for the user to choose. Default to the repo of the current working directory if running inside one.

### 2. Language detection

For the target repo, detect languages by:
- Presence of `package.json` → JavaScript / TypeScript / Node / React / Next.js (further refined below)
- Presence of `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, or `.python-version` → Python
- Presence of `tsconfig.json` → TypeScript
- Presence of `next.config.{js,ts,mjs}` → Next.js
- `react` or `react-dom` in `package.json` dependencies → React
- File extensions across the tree (sample first 500 files)

If a language is detected but not in `@lib/code-analyzers.md`, surface "Language detected but no analyzer registered: {lang}. Skipping that scope." Do not fail the whole scan.

### 3. Tool availability

For each detected language, check whether its preferred analyzer is installed (per `@lib/code-analyzers.md`). If not installed:
- Note in the report which analyzer would be ideal
- Fall back to the grep/AST heuristics defined in the analyzer spec
- Never auto-install tools; surface as a recommendation for the user

## Workflow

### 1. Build the scan plan

For each detected language scope in the target repo:

| Scope | Findings categories |
|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | unused exports, unused imports, unreferenced files, unused dependencies, dead branches |
| React | unused components, unused props, unreachable component files |
| Next.js | unreferenced pages, unused API routes, unused layouts, unused middleware |
| Node.js | unused dependencies, unreachable scripts, orphaned config files |
| Python | unused functions/classes, unused imports, unreachable modules, unused dependencies |

Show the plan as a structured preview before scanning:
```
Code tech debt scan: {repo-name}
Languages: TypeScript (preferred: ts-prune), React, Next.js (heuristic)
Scopes:
  - {N} unused exports
  - {M} unused imports
  - {P} unreferenced files
  - {Q} unused dependencies
  - {R} unused components/props
```

### 2. Run analyzers

Per `@lib/code-analyzers.md`, invoke the configured analyzer for each scope. Capture raw output. If preferred tool missing, run the heuristic fallback (grep-based or AST-based as documented).

Cap walk depth and file count to keep runtime bounded. For very large repos, default to scanning the entry-point graph (from `package.json` `main` / `exports` or Next.js `app/`/`pages/`) and surface "Full-tree scan available with --deep" as an option.

### 3. Cross-reference within the repo

Many findings need confirmation that they're truly unused, not just unused at one analyzer's level:

- An "unused export" might be consumed via dynamic import / string-based require - grep for the name as a string before flagging.
- An "unreferenced file" might be referenced via a glob (e.g. Next.js `pages/`, route auto-discovery) - check framework conventions.
- An "unused dependency" might be runtime-imported via a config file or string template - grep the package name across the tree.

Findings that survive this cross-reference are high-confidence debt. Findings that don't are flagged as **likely-orphan** vs **confirmed-orphan**.

### 4. Group + propose

Surface findings grouped by category. For each, show the file path, line (where applicable), and proposed action:

```
Code tech debt: {repo-name}

Confirmed unused exports ({N})
  src/utils/legacy-format.ts:12   formatLegacy()   → delete export?
  src/hooks/useDeprecated.ts:8    useDeprecated()  → delete file?

Unused imports ({M})
  src/api/handler.ts:3   import { unused } from '...'   → remove line?
  ...

Unreferenced files ({P})
  src/components/OldNav.tsx   no importers   → delete file?
  src/lib/deprecated.ts       last edit > 6mo, no importers   → delete file?

Unused dependencies ({Q})
  lodash.merge (package.json:14)   not imported anywhere   → npm uninstall?

Likely-orphan (low confidence - review)
  src/types/legacy.ts   referenced only by tests, tests may also be orphaned

Total: {total} items
```

### 5. Get consent (structured)

Surface a structured multi-pick:

```
What do you want to act on?
  [ ] Delete confirmed unused exports
  [ ] Delete unreferenced files
  [ ] Remove unused imports (auto-fixable)
  [ ] Uninstall unused dependencies
  [ ] Review likely-orphans individually
  [ ] Preview only - no changes
```

For destructive actions (delete file, uninstall dep), require the consent-trigger phrase from `lib/consent.md` ("remove", "delete them", "apply").

### 6. Execute (if consented)

- Run the corresponding analyzer's fix mode where supported (e.g. `ts-prune --auto-fix` for unused exports if available; `eslint --fix` for unused imports if eslint configured; `npm uninstall <pkg>` for unused deps).
- For file deletions, use `git rm` if the repo is a git repo (CC head's repos always are), so the deletion is staged for the next commit.
- Never push, never commit. Stop at staging.

### 7. Comms output

If running on behalf of a Cowork-driven task (i.e. the request arrived via a `comms/open/<id>-task.md` comm), write a `comms/open/<reply-id>-answer.md`:

```yaml
---
from: cc
to: cowork
type: answer
parent: <original-task-id>
status: open
created: <ISO>
---

Code tech debt scan: {repo-name}
Found: {N} items ({n confirmed unused exports}, {m unreferenced files}, etc.)
Applied: {k} changes (staged for commit, not pushed)
See git status in {PROJECT}.cc/{repo-name}/ for staged changes.
```

If invoked directly (not via comms), just report to the user in chat.

### 8. Report summary

```
✓ Code tech debt scan complete: {repo-name}

Scanned: {N} files across {L} language scopes
Confirmed debt: {n} items
Applied: {k} changes (git-staged)
Remaining (preview only): {m} items

Recommended tools to install for better coverage:
  - ts-prune  (TypeScript unused exports - currently using heuristic)
  - vulture   (Python dead code - currently using heuristic)

Next: review staged changes with `git diff --staged` and commit when ready.
```

## Guard Rails

- [ ] Read-only until user consents per category
- [ ] Cross-reference confirms unused before high-confidence flag
- [ ] No auto-install of analyzer tools - only recommends
- [ ] Cap walk depth + file count; surface --deep option for full scan
- [ ] Never commits, never pushes - stops at git-staged
- [ ] Boundary respected: never edits outside the target repo
- [ ] Comms reply if invoked via task; chat reply if invoked directly
- [ ] Per-language analyzers governed by `@lib/code-analyzers.md` for extensibility

## Error Cases

**No supported language detected:** "No analyzer registered for this repo's stack. Add support in @lib/code-analyzers.md or skip."
**Analyzer tool missing AND no fallback:** Surface installation instructions per `@lib/code-analyzers.md`; offer to run partial scan with available tools.
**File flagged as orphan but recently edited:** Demote to likely-orphan; require user confirmation per item.
**Repo has uncommitted changes:** Surface a warning; user can proceed (changes will mix with their WIP) or abort.
**Repo is not a git repo:** Skip git-rm style staging; ask user how to record deletions.

## Extending to a new language

To add a language scope, edit `@lib/code-analyzers.md`:
1. Define detection signal (config file, dep name, file extension)
2. Specify preferred analyzer tool + invocation
3. Specify fallback heuristic (grep / AST pattern) for when tool missing
4. Define which findings categories the analyzer covers
5. Update this skill's "Build the scan plan" table if a new category emerges

No code change to this SKILL.md required for additive language support - the registry drives it.
